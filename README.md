This is a project to demo how to use [Blazor.Diagrams](https://github.com/Blazor-Diagrams/Blazor.Diagrams), my original post is [here](https://www.slaveoftime.fun/blog/the-usage-of-blazor.diagrams).

> As many people are sending me eamil for a working source code, so here is the work for this.

## How to run

Use visual studio to run directly if you do not want to change any style.

Or

```bash
dotnet fsi build.fsx
```
